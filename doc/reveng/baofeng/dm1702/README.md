# Baofeng DM1701 / Retevis RT72 Protocol and Codeplug Reverse Engineering

This directory contains the tools and documentation of the reverse engineering of the Baofeng 
DM1701 communication protocol and binary codeplug.

The device interface is a simple Serial-Over-USB interface using the STM USB-COM pid/vid 
`0483:5780`. To this end, the radio can be emulated by implementing the protocol. This eases 
the reverse engineering of the codeplug a lot. In particular if the codeplug file generated by the 
manufacturer CPS does not reflect the binary codeplug one-to-one.
