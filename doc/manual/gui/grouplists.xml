<para>
  <emphasis>RX groups</emphasis>, <emphasis>RX group lists</emphasis> or simply 
  <glossterm>Group List</glossterm>s are just lists of <glossterm>Group Call</glossterm>s you wish 
  to receive on each channel. Of cause, you may want to receive calls to different talk groups on one 
  channel, hence you have to create these lists of talk groups beforehand.

<para>
  When creating a new RX group list or when editing one, the <guilabel>Edit RX Group 
  List</guilabel> dialog will open. Within this dialog, you can change the name of the group at the
  top. In the center of the dialog, you will find the list of group calls of this group list. You 
  can add group call to the list by clicking on the <guibutton>Add Contact</guibutton> button on 
  the bottom. You can also remove contacts from the list by selecing the contact and clicking on the 
  <guibutton>Remove Contact</guibutton> button. When you are done editing the group list, click on 
  the <guibutton>Ok</guibutton> button. The <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton> button will discard all 
  changes and closes the dialog.
