  <title>Creating Channels</title>
</info>

<para>
  Creating the list of channels for the DMR radio is the most cumbersome task. Remember, each
  repeater has two time-slots with possibly multiple talk-groups assigned to each time slot. For
  the sake of convenience, it is reasonable to define a channel for each talk-group you are
  interested for each time-slot on every repeater. Thus, instead of a single channel per
  analog repeater, you will likely define at least 3-4 channels per repeater in DMR. 
</para>

<para>
  To ease the burden of creating a lot of channels, <application>qdmr</application> implements some
  features that should help you in creating these channel. One feature is the automatic retrieval 
  of repeater input and output frequencies from
  <link xlink:href="https://repeatermap.de">repeatermap.de</link>. This is a world-wide map
  of ham-radio repeaters.
</para>

<tip>
  <para>
    When you enter your locator into the settings dialog (see <xref linkend="guiSettingsDialog"/>), 
    <application>qdmr</application> will provide you with a list of nearby repeater and fill in the
    input and output frequencies. This feature works for both, analog and DMR repeaters.

<para> 
  The <guilabel>Channels</guilabel> tab shows the list of all defined channels, irrespective 
  whether they are analog or digital (DMR) channels. You may add an analog or digital channel by 
  clicking on the <guibutton>Add Analog Channel</guibutton> or 
  <guibutton>Add Digital Channel</guibutton> button on the bottom, respectively. You can also 
  delete a channel, by selecting that channel in the list and clicking on the
  <guibutton>Delete Channel</guibutton> button at the bottom. You may move a channel up or down the
  list by selecting that channel and clicking on the <guibutton>arrow-up</guibutton> or 
  <guibutton>-down</guibutton> button to the left, respectively. Finally you can edit a channel by 
  double-clicking it in the list. 
</para>

<tip>
  <para>
    The number of channels usually grow fast and it becomes hard to find channels within the list. 
    To search the list for any channel name or frequency, just hit <accel>Ctrl+F</accel> to open a 
    search box. This search feature is present in all lists. The channel list, however, is likely 
    the largest.

  <title>Edit digital channels</title>

<para>
  When you double-click on a digital channel or click on the <guibutton>Add Digital 
  Channel</guibutton> button, the digital channel editor dialog will be shown. This dialog allows 
  you to edit or create digital channels.

 <title>The digital channel editor.</title>
</screenshot>

<para>
  The dialog is limited to the DMR-channel settings that are relevant for amateur radio. Thus, it
  is much smaller that the typical dialogs to edit DMR channels in commercial CPSs.
</para>

<para>
  The <guilabel>Name</guilabel>, <guilabel>Rx</guilabel> and <guilabel>Tx Frequency</guilabel> 
  fields contain the chosen name of the channel as well as the transmit and receive frequencies. 
  The latter can be set automatically by using the repeater auto-completion feature: Start to enter
  the call-sign of a repeater and the RX/TX frequencies will be set using the information from
  <link xlink:href="https://repeatermap.de">repeatermap.de</link>. For simplex-channels RX
  and TX frequencies must be identical.
</para>

<para>
  The <guilabel>Power</guilabel> setting specifies the power used on that channel. For a nearby 
  repeater, you may reduce the power. <guilabel>Tx Timeout</guilabel> (<glossterm>TOT</glossterm>)
  specifies the transmit timeout in seconds. This limits the continuous transmission time to this 
  period. A value of 0 disables the timeout. <glossterm>Scan List</glossterm> allows to specify the 
  scan list associated with this channel. If a scan is started on this channel, this scan list will 
  be used. Each channel may have a different scan list.
</para>

<para>
  The <guilabel>Tx Admit</guilabel> field specifies the <glossterm>Admit Criterion</glossterm>,
  under which condition you are allowed to transmit on the channel. For DMR reapeater channels this 
  should be set to <guilabel>Color Code</guilabel>, this means that you may only transmit if the 
  radio received the correct color code of the repeater before. On simplex channels 
  <guilabel>Channel Free</guilabel> should be chosen.
</para>

<para>
  The <glossterm>Color Code</glossterm> specifies the color code of the repeater. For simplex 
  channels, this should be set to 1. The <glossterm>Time Slot</glossterm> specifies the time-slot 
  of the repeater for this channel. All repeaters have two time slots but different talk groups 
  might be associated with each time slot. The <glossterm>Group List</glossterm> specifies the 
  list of group-calls you want to receive on this time-slot. The <guilabel>Tx Contact</guilabel> 
  specifies the default <glossterm>Transmit Contact</glossterm> you want to call on this channel 
  when pressing the PTT button. Finally, the <guilabel>GPS System</guilabel> specifies how you 
  location information is send over this channel (selecting <guilabel>None</guilabel> disables 
  GPS for this channel).
</para>

<para>
  If <guilabel>Show Commercial Features</guilabel> is enabled in the settings dialog (see 
  <xref linkend="guiSettingsDialog"/>), a tab bar is shown at the top. There you can also access
  the device specific settings for the GPS system. 
</para>

  <title>Edit analog channels</title>
</info>

<para>
  When you double-click on an analog channel or click on the <guibutton>Add Analog 
  Channel</guibutton> button, the analog-channel-editor dialog will be shown. This dialog allows 
  you to edit or create analog (FM) channels.

 <title>The analog channel editor.</title>
</screenshot>

<para>
  The left column of field are identical to the digital channel dialog, that is 
  <guilabel>Name</guilabel>, <guilabel>Rx</guilabel> and <guilabel>Tx Frequency</guilabel>, 
  <guilabel>Power</guilabel>, <guilabel>Tx Timeout</guilabel> and <guilabel>Scan List</guilabel>.
</para>

<para>
  Like for digital channels, analog channels may also have an <guilabel>Tx Admit</guilabel> 
  criterion. Possible options are <guilabel>Always</guilabel>, <guilabel>Channel Free</guilabel> 
  and <guilabel>Tone</guilabel>. For FM repeaters the <guilabel>Always</guilabel> option should be 
  chosen to allow for a quick turn-around in a QSO. For simplex channels <guilabel>Channel 
  Free</guilabel> should be chosen, as it only allows to transmit when the simplex channel is free.
  Selecting <guilabel>Channel Free</guilabel> on repeater channels, would prevent transmission while
  the repeater is active although the last transmission already ended.
</para>

<para>
  The <guilabel>Squelch</guilabel> field specifies the squelch threshold. <guilabel>Rx</guilabel>
  and <guilabel>Tx Tone</guilabel> specify the <glossterm>CTCSS</glossterm>/<glossterm>DCS</glossterm>
  tones for this channel/repeater. The <guilabel>Rx Tone</guilabel> specifies the subtone that is needed 
  to open the squelch. The <guilabel>Tx Tone</guilabel> specifies the tone that gets transmitted (e.g., 
  to open the repeater).
</para>

<para>
  Finally <guilabel>Bandwidth</guilabel> specifies the band-width of the transmission (i.e., 12.5 
  or 25 kHz).
</para>

<para>
  If <guilabel>Show Commercial Features</guilabel> is enabled in the settings dialog (see 
  <xref linkend="guiSettingsDialog"/>), a tab bar is shown at the top. There you can also access
  the device specific settings for the GPS system.
