<para>
  The radio settings section contains all radio-wide settings. For example the microphone level, 
  boot text etc. For now, there aren't many.
</para>

<para>
  As an example, consider the following general settings
</para>

<example pgwide="1">
  <title>General radio-wide settings.</title>
  <programlisting language="yaml"><![CDATA[settings:
  micLevel: 6
  speech: false
  introLine1: qDMR
  introLine2: DM3MAT
  defaultID: id1 
  squelch: 1
  vox: 0
  power: High
]]></programlisting>
</example>

<para>
  Here, the microphone amplification is set to 6, the speech synthesis is disabled, the two boot
  text lines are set to <quote>qDMR</quote> and <quote>DM3MAT</quote> respectively and the default 
  DMR radio ID is set to <quote>id1</quote>. The latter is the id of a radio ID defined below. 
</para>

<para>
  Also, the radio-wide default squelch, VOX and power level is set. These values can be referenced
  later in channels. Also, some radios do not allow for these settings to be applied on a 
  per-channel basis. For these radios, these values are used.
