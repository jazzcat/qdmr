<para>
  Scan lists are simple lists of channels to scan. A scan list might be associated with a channel.
</para>

<para>
  As an example, consider the following scan list:
</para>

<example pgwide="1">
  <title></title>
  <programlisting><![CDATA[scanLists:
  - id: scan1
    name: KW
    channels: [ch4, ch5, ch76, ch77, ch97, ch102, ch68, ch112] 
]]></programlisting>
</example>

<para>
  This scan list has the ID <emphasis>scan1</emphasis>, the name <emphasis>KW</emphasis> and contains several channels 
  (both analog and digital).
</para>

<table>
  <thead> <tr><td>Element</td> <td>Description</td></tr> </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><token>id</token></td>
      <td>Specifies the ID of the scan list. This ID can then be used to reference this scan 
        list in <xref linkend="cpChannels"/>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><token>name</token></td>
      <td>Specifies the name of the scan list. Any string is valid here.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><token>primary</token></td>
      <td>Specifies the primary priority channel. Usually this channel is scanned very frequently. 
        If set, this must be a reference to a channel. If the tag <token>!selected</token> is used here,
        the channel from which the scan got started is used as the primary priority channel.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><token>secondary</token></td>
      <td>Specifies the secondary priority channel. Usually this channel is scanned frequently. 
        If set, this must be a reference to a channel. If the tag <token>!selected</token> is used here,
        the channel from which the scan got started is used as the secondary priority channel.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><token>revert</token></td>
      <td>Specifies the revert channel. That is, the channel to transmit on irrespective of the 
        current channel being scanned. If set, this must be a reference to a channel. If the tag 
        <token>!selected</token> is used here, the channel from which the scan got started is used 
        as the transmit channel. If omitted the radio will transmit on the currently scanned 
        channel.</td>

      <td><token>channels</token></td>
