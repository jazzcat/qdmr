    <glossterm>Admit Criterion</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
      <para>
        The admit criterion specifies a criterion under which transmissions on a channel are 
        allowed. These criteria can be defined for both, analog and DMR channels. Irrespective of
        the channel type, the admit criteria <quote>always</quote> and <quote>channel free</quote>
        can be selected. The former simply always allows to transmit. The former requires the 
        channel to be free. 
      </para>
      <para>
        For analog channels, usually there is also the criterion <quote>tone</quote>. This 
        criterion would only allow transmissions if the matching CTCSS tone or DCS code has been
        received. For analog repeater operation, the criterion <quote>channel free</quote> should
        not be used as this would prevent any transmissions while the repeater is active.
      </para>
      <para>
        For digital channels, usually there is also the criterion <quote>color code</quote>. This
        criterion would only allow transmissions if the matching color code has been received. To 
        this end, this criterion is similar to the <quote>tone</quote> criterion for analog 
        channels.

    <glossterm>All Call</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
      <para>
        An all-call is a special type of an DMR call to a special number (<emphasis>16777215</emphasis>). 
        All radios are supposed to receive this call irrespective of their particular configuration. This
        call type is usually used in emergency situations or on simplex channels.
      </para>
      <para>
        Unfortunately, the local talk group (number 9) is frequently used on simplex channel although only 
        those radios will receive calls to this talk group if it is in the group list assigned to the 
        simplex channel. To be on the save side, use the all-call for simplex calls.

    <glossterm>Automatic Packet Reporting System</glossterm> <acronym>APRS</acronym>
    <glossdef>
      <para>
        The Automatic Packet Reporting System is a protocol that uses single broadcast frequencies 
        to transmit small amounts of information though a network of repeaters. Usually but not 
        limited to position reports. This allows other services (e.g.,
        <link xlink:href="https://aprs.fi">aprs.fi</link> to display that information on a map. The
        usual APRS frequencies are 144.390 MHz (North America), 144.800 MHz (Europe) and 
        145.175 MHz (Australia).

    <glossterm>Codeplug</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
      <para>
        The term <quote>codeplug</quote> is rather loosely defined. Usually it refers to the binary
        representation of the configuration of a radio that is written to the radio to configure it.
        It contains all contacts, channels, zones, settings, etc that form the configuration of the
        radio.
      </para>

  <glossentry>
    <glossterm>Color Code</glossterm>
    <para>
      A color code is some additional information attached to each DMR call. It is used to prevent 
      interference between repeaters with overlapping ranges that operate at the same frequencies. 
      In amateur radio, this may only happen in very densely populated areas. It is much more 
      frequent in commercial applications, where a single company may got only a few frequencies 
      assigned but needs much more repeaters to cover a campus reliably.
    </para>
    <para>
      The color code is a number between 0 and 16. A radio or repeater may only react to calls with
      matching color codes. Hence beside the actual input and output frequencies, the color code of
      a repeater must be known to be able to access it.

    <glossterm>DAPNET</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
      <para>
        <acronym>DAPNET</acronym>, short for Decentralized Amateur Paging Network does exactly what
        it says. It is a network of transmitters that transmit pager messages in the UHF band, 
        usually at 439.9875 MHz. As the old pager operated at a frequency near by, they can be 
        modified to operate at that frequency and can therefore be used in amateur radio. 
      </para>
      <para>
        The DAPNET is particularly popular with emergency operators as it allows for an convenient
        and reliable multicast notification.

    <glossterm>EchoLink</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
      <para>
        EchoLink is a network of analog FM repeaters that allows to link repeaters within this 
        network temporarily. That is, two FM repeaters that are linked via EchoLink behave like 
        a single repeater irrespective of their location. This network also allows to access
        the repeaters directly though the internet. This is particularly helpful if one cannot 
        reach any repeater.

    <glossterm>Group Call</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
      <para>
        A group call is simply a call to a talk group. That is, not to a single participant but 
        rather to a group of participants. Every participant that has this talk group in their 
        group list can receive this call. See also <glossterm>Group List</glossterm> and
        <glossterm>Talk Group</glossterm>.

  <glossentry>
    <glossterm>Group List</glossterm>
    <glossdef>
      <para>
        A group list is a simple list of talk groups. A group list is then assigned to a channel
        to specify which group calls to receive on that channel. If a talk group is not listed in 
        the group list of a channel, the radio will ignore calls to this talk group on that 
        channel.
      </para>
      <para>
        The DMR network cannot know which talk groups you are interested in. You have to tell your
        radio using group lists.

    <glossterm>Transmit Timeout</glossterm> <acronym>TOT</acronym>
    <glossdef>
      <para>
        Specifies the time of continuos transmission, after which the transmission is interrupted 
        automatically. This prevents the accidental blocking of a repeater or talk group by 
        transmitting continuously.
