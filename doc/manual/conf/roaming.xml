<para>
  Roaming zones allow to stay in contact with a particular talk group when moving round and the current repeater 
  gets out of range. In this case, the radio will search for the strongest repeater in a list (the so-called 
  <emphasis>roaming zone</emphasis>) and switch to this repeater.

<para>
  Therefore, a roaming zone is a simple channel list. The first column specifies the ID of the zone. This 
  ID can be used in the digital channel table to associate a channel with a specific roaming zone.
  The second column specifies the name of the zone and the third column holds the comma-separated list of 
  channel in each zone.
